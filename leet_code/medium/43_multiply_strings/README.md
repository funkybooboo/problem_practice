Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.


Example 1:

Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"

Example 2:

Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"

Example 3:

Input: num1 = "3", num2 = "4"
Output: "12"

Example 4:

Input: num1 = "111", num2 = "222"
Output: "24642"


Constraints:

    1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200
    num1 and num2 consist of digits only.
    Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
