You are given a string s. The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.

Return the score of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "hello"
Output: 13
Explanation:
The ASCII values of the characters in s are: 'h' = 104, 'e' = 101, 'l' = 108, 'o' = 111. So, the score of s would be |104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111| = 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13.

Example 2:

Input: s = "zaz"
Output: 50
Explanation:
The ASCII values of the characters in s are: 'z' = 122, 'a' = 97. So, the score of s would be |122 - 97| + |97 - 122| = 25 + 25 = 50.

Example 3:

Input: s = "code"
Output: 24
Explanation: The ASCII values of the characters in the given string are: 'c' = 99, 'o' = 111, 'd' = 100, and 'e' = 101. The score of s will be: |111 - 99| + |100 - 111| + |101 - 100|.

Example 4:

Input: s = "neetcode"
Output: 65


Constraints:

    2 <= s.length <= 100
    s consists only of lowercase English letters.
